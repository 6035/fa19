# Phase 1

__ANYTHING WRITTEN HERE OVERRIDES INSTRUCTIONS IN THE HANDOUT__

Read the __[HANDOUT](../materials/handouts/04-semantics-project.pdf)__.

## Submission

Keep in mind that this phase is not graded. However you will be submitting PHASE3 and PHASE5 using these instructions, so we want you practice it using this phase.

1. create a branch in your team repo, and name it `phase2-submission`
1. commit/push to this branch as many times as you want before/after the deadline
1. we will grade the __MOST RECENT__ commit made to this branch, that was made __BEFORE__ the deadline
    - so if the deadline is 5pm, and you made commits at 3pm, 4pm and 6pm, we will grade the 4pm one
